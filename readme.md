## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains over 1400 video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# Quickstart using docker!

We now got an inbuild docker-compose with which you are able to easily setup a local development environment. Our environment contains the following containers:

- **nginx** representing our web server
- **php-fpm** to handle the php stuff
- **db** representing a mariadb database server
- **phpMyAdmin** to access the db container
- **php-migrater** to migrate our database

The docker-compose file can be started using the following command:
``docker-compose up -d``

To stop the environment just type
``docker-compose down``

The migration can be triggered with the following command
``docker-compose up php-migrater``

That's it. Have fun deploying.
**Attention! The php-migrater will be scheduled executed on each docker-compose start!**
