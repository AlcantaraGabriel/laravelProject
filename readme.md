## Dev Setup

Follow these steps to get a working local copy of Clique on your local (Windows with XAMPP) machine, along with some GitHub basics:

- Install [GitHub] (https://github-windows.s3.amazonaws.com/GitHubSetup.exe) 
  - afterwards please give me your GitHub usernames so I can set you as collaborators
- Install [Composer] (https://getcomposer.org/Composer-Setup.exe)
  - during installation, point the PHP executable to `C:\xampp\php`
  - while you're at it, set PHP in your PATH environment variable too
- Open GitHub in your machine, then clone this repo into your `/htdocs' folder (or whatever web root you have set)
  - if I am still not available by this time, then fork (make your own branch) this repo instead and clone your fork into your machine. You'll have to send a pull request for every commit that you would like to make. [guide](https://help.github.com/categories/collaborating/) for an overview)
- Set Up Clique:

- Whenever you make changes to the application:
