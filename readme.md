Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, queueing, and caching.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## What to Use Laravel for and When to Use It

Laravel is designed to be simple, easy to use MVC compliant web app framework that supports rapid application development. It is very robust and gives you the ability to build web applications of all sizes and complexity within no time. Laravelâ€™s well documented framework helps to improve productivity and cooperability to build large scale projects that require collaboration with others. It has clean and simple routing system, an effective ORM, database layer and quick and functional core that can be extended. Huge amount of development time can be saved with the use of its numerous tools, components, easy integration with third-party libraries and supportive community. Essentially the best time to use Laravel is when you want to learn a new MVC framework and build a complete web application while having plenty of community support behind it.
